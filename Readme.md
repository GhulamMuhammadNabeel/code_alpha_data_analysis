# 📊 CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I completed during my **Data Analytics Internship at [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech/)**.

This internship helped me apply and grow my skills in **web scraping**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data visualization**, and **sentiment analysis** using real-world datasets and Python libraries.

## ✅ Internship Tasks Overview

### 🔹 Task 1: Web Scraping
- Scraped quotes data using **BeautifulSoup** and **requests** in Python.
- Extracted quotes, authors, and tags from a static HTML site.
- Cleaned and saved the data into CSV for analysis.

### 🔹 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed deep EDA on the scraped quotes dataset.
- Used **pandas** and **matplotlib**/**seaborn** for visual insights.
- Analyzed quote length, most frequent tags, authors, etc.

### 🔹 Task 3: Data Visualization
- Visualized key insights with:
  - Bar plots
  - Pie charts
  - Word clouds
- Tools: **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **WordCloud**

### 🔹 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis
- Used **Amazon Product Reviews Dataset**.
- Preprocessed text data (stopword removal, tokenization, etc.).
- Performed sentiment classification using:
  - **TextBlob** for polarity/subjectivity
  - **VADER** for compound sentiment scores
